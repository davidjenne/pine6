* Licensing
	* All third-party assets (scripts, fonts, images, etc) need to have explicit licensing info included in the theme. The scripts already have this in their header, so we just need to deal with Font Awesome.

	* Google Fonts need to be enqueued in a way that allows translators to turn them off (sometimes necessary if a certain font doesn't support a language's special characters).
	* We also need to include code that defeats Google Font enqueueing if the user has active Custom Fonts. This can go in inc/wpcom.php, which is enqueued automatically on WP.com if it exists

	* Remove the RSS feed icon.
	* Replace screenshot.png with a realistic representation of the theme (do not include any branding in the screenshot). 880px x 660px.

	* i18n for date.php L27
	* Prefix all enqueue style and scripts handles with 'mayer-'
	* We're missing the $themecolors array, which can go in inc/wpcom.php so it's enqueued automatically:
	* Moved all files previous in 'includes' into 'inc'

* Properly escaping values and URLs throughout the theme.
	* esc_url for partials/attachment-pagination.php L15
	* esc_url on the href for partials/avatar.php L3
